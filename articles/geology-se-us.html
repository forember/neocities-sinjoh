      Geologic History of the Southeastern United States
    </h1>

    <p>
      Observations presented here were collected either by direct observation in the
      field, or&mdash;as is the case for zircon ages and metamorphic ages&mdash;provided by
      Dr. David Barbeau.
    </p>

    <h2>Observations</h2>
    <p>
      There are late Mesoproterozoic zircons (1.2&ndash;1 Ga) in the Cedar Shoals Gneiss
      (Site D), the Lake Toxaway Gneiss (Site L), the Great Smokey Group (site S),
      and in the cores of Silurian and Devonian zircons in the Table Rock Orthogneiss
      (Sites F, H, and I)
    </p>
    <p>
      There are late Neoproterozoic zircons (~600 Ma) in the Cedar Shoals Gneiss
      (Site D) and Cambrian (~500 Ma) zircons in the muscovite schist (PS2) at the
      Lake Murray Spillway. The ultramafic rocks in the Addie Ultramafic
      Complex&mdash;the dunite and peridotite at the Addie Quarry (Site O) and the
      protolith to the garnet orthogneissic amphibolite in Sylva (Site Q)&mdash;are
      estimated to have formed in the middle Neoproterozoic through the Cambrian
      (700&ndash;500 Ma), and the silt, sand, carbon, and sulfur that would form the
      greenschist at Newfound Gap (Site T) and the siltstone in the Rome Formation
      (Site W) are estimated to have been deposited in the middle Cambrian (520&ndash;500
      Ma). The sediment that would form the Great Smokey Group (Site S) greenschist
      was also deposited in the middle Neoproterozoic through the Cambrian (700&ndash;500
      Ma). The sediment that would form the low-grade schist in the Poor Mountain
      Formation (Sites G, I, and possibly J) is generally assumed to have been
      deposited in the Neoproterozoic (1 Ga&ndash;541 Ma).
    </p>
    <p>
      The limestone in the Moccasin Formation (Site W) formed in the Ordivician
      (485&ndash;445 Ma), and the limestone in the Knox Formation (Site U) formed in the
      late Ordivician (~450 Ma). The sand that would form the sandstone at Clinch
      Mountain (Site V) was deposited in the Silurian (444&ndash;423 Ma), and the beds in
      the Clinch Mountain sandstone are curved.</p>
      <p>The zircons in the quartzite and amphibolite paragneiss (QFG2) at the Lake
      Murray Spillway are Silurian to early Devonian (450&ndash;400 Ma), and the zircons
      in the granitic orthogneiss there (LMG) are late Silurian/early Devonian (~419
      Ga). The zircon age distribution in the Tallulah Falls Formation (Site E)
      schist (which has some augen) has a fairly tight peak around 440 Ma (early
      Silurian).  There are also some zircons of the same age in the Ashe Formation.
      The zircons in the Table Rock Gneiss (Sites F, H, and I) range from Silurian to
      Devonian (450&ndash;380 Ma). Some of those zircons have late Mesoproterozoic (1 Ga)
      cores.
    </p>
    <p>
      The zircons in the White Side Granite intrusion and its formation range from
      late Silurian through the Mississippian (430&ndash;320 Ma). The formation sits
      200-300 miles inland from the current coast. The siliciclastic Ohio Shale (Site
      X) formed in the Devonian (419&ndash;359 Ma), and the sedimentary rock above it at
      Pound Gap, the Grainger Formation, contains stratified, gently inclined
      siltstone and sandstone interbedded with shale similar to the Ohio Shale.
    </p>
    <p>
      Monazite uranium-thorium-lead dating indicates that the Cedar Shoals Gneiss
      (Site D) metamorphosed in the early Mississippian (~350 Ma). The gneiss also
      has intrusions of feldspar pegmatite. At Pound Gap (Site X), the Grainger
      Formation was also forming in the early Mississippian.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the middle Mississippian, the Newman Limestone (Site X) was forming. The
      Lower Pennington Formation, middle-to-late Mississippian in age at the same
      site, features limestone with fossils interbedded with clastic shale in the
      upper parts of the Lower Pennington, the rock transitions to all clastic shale
      in tight, periodic light and dark alternating bands and then to sandstone with
      symmetric fossilized ripples and some cross-bedding.
    </p>
    <p>
      The large majority of zircons in the low-grade schist at Rainbow Falls (Site
      M), part of the Ashe Formation, formed at the very end of the Mississippian
      (325 Ma). In the early Pennsylvanian, the Upper Pennington Formation (Site X)
      was forming. It features alternating (but non-rhythmic) layers with and without
      iron oxide.
    </p>
    <p>
      Argon-argon dating indicates that peak metamorphism at the Lake Murray Spillway
      occurred near the end of the Pennsylvanian (~300 Ma), and the schist there
      contains small kyanite and staurolite. The foliation in the gneiss there
      indicates the maximum direction of compression to be northwest-southeast. The
      zircons in the Pageland granite at Forty Acre Rock formed at the beginning of
      the Permian. Fractures in the granite indicate northwest-southeast compression
      shortly after formation. As well, the Breathitt Group, medium-to-coarse-grained
      sandstone interbedded with coal, was deposited in the early Permian and
      contains zircons matching those in Appalachian rocks.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are early Jurassic zircons in the diabase at Flat Creek Dike. The
      sandstone at Peachtree, which exhibits fossilized burrows, formed in the
      Eocene.
    </p>

    <h2>Interpretation</h2>
    <p>
      The late Mesoproterozoic zircons at sites D, L, S, F, H, and I are the same age
      as the North American basement and probably indicate that the rocks at each of
      these sites either are the same rock as the North American basement (as is
      likely the case for the orthogneiss at Lake Toxaway) or received sediment from
      North America before they metamorphosed (as is the more likely case for the
      other sites).
    </p>
    <p>
      The late Neoproterozoic and Cambrian zircons at Cedar Shoals and the Lake
      Murray Spillway indicate that there was magmatism in a region from which
      sediment could be transported to these sites before their rocks&rsquo; lithification.
      To the west, the middle Neoproterozoic through Cambrian ultramafic rocks in the
      Addie Ultramafic Complex indicate that there was likely a divergent boundary
      between what is now Lake Toxaway and Waterrock sometime in that range. The
      formations&rsquo; shape suggests that they are obducted crust, indicating that there
      was a subduction zone there sometime since their formation. The formation of
      the Rome Formation and the protolith to the Newfound Gap greenschist in the
      middle Cambrian indicates that there was an ocean there then.
    </p>
    <p>
      The formation of the limestones at sites W and U in the Ordivician indicate
      that there was a shallow sea or continental shelf there at that time, and the
      sandstone at Clinch Mountain with its curved bedding indicates that there were
      river systems there in the Silurian.
    </p>
    <p>
      The late Silurian/early Devonian zircons in LMG indicates that there was
      magmatism at what is now the Lake Murray Spillway at that time. The same is
      true of the early Silurian zircons at Tallulah Falls. The late Mesoproterozoic
      cores of some of the Silurian to Devonian zircons in the Table Rock Gneiss
      indicate that magma intruded sediment or rocks containing late Mesoproterozoic
      zircons (which likely came from rocks that now form the North American
      basement) in the Silurian through the Devonian.
    </p>
    <p>
      The late Silurian through Mississippian zircons in the White Side Granite
      indicate that there was magmatism there then. The Ohio Shale at Pound Gap
      indicates that there was likely deep ocean there in the Devonian. The early
      Mississippian Grainger Formation indicates that there were likely intermittent
      turbidity currents in a similar environment to the formation environment of the
      Ohio Shale. This description matches deep ocean near a continental shelf (the
      turbidity events are collapses from the shelf).
    </p>
    <p>
      Assuming that the early Mississippian result from the monazite
      uranium-thorium-lead dating of the Cedar Shoals Gneiss is accurate, this
      indicates that there was fairly high-grade metamorphism there in the early
      Mississippian. The gneiss has intrusions of feldspar pegmatite within it.
      Sodium plagioclase and potassium feldspar melt at about 600&deg;C. Either the
      rock reached this temperature, or there were volatiles that got carried down
      with the rock to its site of metamorphism. The burial of the Cedar Shoals
      protolith is highly unlikely to have been due to a collision with North
      America, as the Grainger Formation indicates that there was deep ocean to the
      west of the Cedar Shoals area throughout the early Mississippian. It is also
      unlikely that the metamorphism occurred in another large continent if the late
      Mesoprotozoic zircons in the Cedar Shoals Gneiss are in fact of North American
      origin. Instead, the Cedar Shoals protolith could have been on either a long
      peninsula off of the North American continent or&mdash;more likely&mdash;a part of the
      continent that rifted off of the main continent. If the area that is now Lake
      Toxaway was also part of this region, this would explain the origin of the Lake
      Toxaway Gneiss. As well, if it was indeed a rifted-off archipelago featuring a
      subduction zone to the east and a back-arc basin to the west, this would
      explain the origin of the Addie Ultramafic Complex (in the middle of the
      basin), the seemingly marine rocks at Newfound Gap, in the Knox Formation, at
      Copper Creek, and at Pound Gap (in the basin), and much of the magmatism in the
      area from the Cambrian through the early Mississippian (from the subduction).
      This peninsula or archipelago then collided with either some small exotic
      terrane or possibly the African continent. The former seems more likely due to
      continued magmatism in this region after the early Mississippian, such as the
      formation of the late Mississippian zircons that would end up in the Ashe
      Formation. This other terrane may well have been the origin of the Cambrian
      zircons&mdash;and indeed much of the material&mdash;at the Lake Murray Spillway.
    </p>
    <p>
      The metamorphism, compression, and thrust faults throughout the whole
      Appalachian region which likely occurred near the end of the Pennsylvanian were
      probably caused by the Appalachian orogeny. The African continent, either
      carrying with it the Cedar Shoals peninsula or archipelago from an early
      Mississippian collision, or having collided with said peninsula or archipelago
      shortly before, collided with the North American continent, forming the
      Appalachian mountains and metamorphosing almost all of the rock currently
      exposed from Cedar Shoals to Townsend, Tennessee. Plutons like that at Forty
      Acre Rock likely formed as the last bit of magmatism from the subduction zone
      under Africa right before the orogeny.
    </p>
    <p>
      The diabase at Flat Creek Dike likely formed in the continental rift as the
      North American and African continents began to separate to form the Atlantic
      Ocean. The sandstone at Peachtree indicates that sea levels were likely much
      higher in the Eocene, as the coast was near where Columbia is today.
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>
      What seems the most likely explanation of the evolution of what is now the
      southeast United States is the formation of what is now the North American
      basement in the late Mesoproterozoic, followed by the formation of a subduction
      zone with a volcanic arc and a back-arc basin sometime from the middle
      Neoproterozoic through the Cambrian, then a collision of a small exotic terrane
      with the arc in the early Mississippian, and then a collision with the African
      continent in the late Pennsylvanian, forming the Appalachians, then a
      continental rift forming in the early Jurassic, separating the two continents
      again and forming the Atlantic. However, the observations presented here are
      not hard, and there are many other fairly likely possibilities that would
      explain the observations even if they are accurate.
